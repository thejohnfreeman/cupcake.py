Cupcake is a thin layer over [CMake][] and [Conan][] that tries to offer
a better user experience in the style of [Yarn][] or [Poetry][].

[CMake]: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake.1.html
[Conan]: https://docs.conan.io/
[Yarn]: https://yarnpkg.com/en/

Etymology
---------

I love [Make][], but it's just not cross-platform. Just about every other
single letter prefix of "-ake" is taken, including the obvious candidate for
C++ (but stolen by C#), [Cake][]. From there, it's a small step to Cppcake,
which needs an easy pronunciation. "Cupcake" works. I prefer names to be
spelled with an unambiguous pronunciation so that readers are not left
confused, so I might as well name the tool Cupcake. A brief [Google
search](https://www.google.com/search?q=c%2B%2B+cupcake) appears to confirm
the name is unclaimed in the C++ community.
