Cupcake is a thin layer over CMake_ and Conan_ that tries to offer
a better user experience in the style of Yarn_ or Poetry_.

Etymology
---------

I love Make_, but it's just not cross-platform. Just about every other
single letter prefix of "-ake" is taken, including the obvious candidate for
C++ (but stolen by C#), Cake_. From there, it's a small step to Cppcake,
which needs an easy pronunciation. "Cupcake" works. I prefer names to be
spelled with an unambiguous pronunciation so that readers are not left
confused, so I might as well name the tool Cupcake. A brief `Google
search`__ appears to confirm
the name is unclaimed in the C++ community.
